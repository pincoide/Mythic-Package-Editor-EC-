# Mythic-Package-Editor-EC-
UOP editor compatible with EC client of Ultilma Online

The tool works for reading UOP files and extract AND edit the content correctly.

The rework is fully complete!

Now it includes:
- Better brute force search
- Mass replace feature.
- Improved interface.
- More info, and text/image preview (without unpacking).
- Cleaner code, and tons of bugs fixed.

If you want to help let me know!


Next objective: expanding the mythic.package library to add the ability to read/save as many files as possible of the client files (animations, tiledata, statics, etc...). If someone wants to help, let me know.

# Mythic-Package-Editor-EC-
UOP editor compatible with EC client of Ultilma Online

The tool works for reading UOP files and extract AND edit the content correctly.

The next objective is:

- Determine file names: while it works (more or less) if you know the exact name, it would be best to find a way to automatically find the file names. 
I've added a button to parse the file names inside a folder (and sub-folder) to the ones inside the uop, but it doesn't seem to be effective...
For some reason some file names are not recognized (even if you know exactly its name).


If you have any idea on how to fix/improve the tool, feel free to contact me on discord: Pinco#5969
